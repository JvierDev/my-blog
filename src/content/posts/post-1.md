## Why pnpm Stands Out

Package managers are essential tools for developers, and pnpm (Performant npm) has rapidly gained popularity for its efficiency and unique approach to handling dependencies. Unlike traditional tools, pnpm uses hard links and symlinks, reducing disk space usage and speeding up installations.

## Key Features:

1. **Efficient Storage**: Dependencies are stored in a single content-addressable storage, drastically cutting down redundancy.

2. **Fast Installations**: pnpm caches packages globally, ensuring subsequent installations are lightning-fast.

3. **Strict Mode**: Ensures dependencies are resolved correctly, avoiding unexpected issues.

## Getting Started with pnpm

1. Install pnpm globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Initialize a project with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm init
```

3. Add dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add react
```

## Why Developers Love pnpm
